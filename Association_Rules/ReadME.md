## Association Rule Mining
### The task
![Grocery](https://github.com/sagar-chadha/Predictive-Modelling-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment2/Assignment2_SagarChadha_files/figure-markdown_github/grocery.jpg)
Using transactions data from a grocery store, I use association rule mining to get a sense of customer purchase patterns for use by the store management.

### Practical Applications
This has multiple possible applications - <br>
* Planning teams can look at these associations and build forecasting rules off of it.
* Store managers can utilise these rules to place items that sell together closeby.
* This information can help store managers plan discounts and promotions more effectively. Knowing which items sell together, they can better understand how to completely evaluate the impact of discounts and promotions on an item.

### Repository Structure
`Association_Rules.rmd` has the R code I used to prepare my final report. <br>
`Association_Rules.md` is the final markdown report with my analysis.
