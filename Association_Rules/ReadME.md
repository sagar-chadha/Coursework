## Association Rule Mining
### The task
![Grocery](https://github.com/sagar-chadha/Predictive-Modelling-Assignments/blob/master/Assignment2/Assignment2_SagarChadha_files/figure-markdown_github/grocery.jpg)
Using transactions data from a grocery store, I use association rule mining to get a sense of customer purchase patterns for use by the store management. This has multiple possible applications - <br>
* Planning teams can look at these associations and build forecasting rules off of it.
* Store managers can utilise these rules to place items that sell together closeby.
* This information can help store managers plan discounts and promotions more effectively. They now know what the impact of having a discount on one particular can do to other items that usually sell with it.
