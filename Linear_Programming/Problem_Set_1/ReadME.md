This repository contains my work from the Optimisation Class, specifically my attempts at solving some basic linear programming problems. 

### What are linear programming problems?
Linear programming problems are essentially optimization problems where both the constraints and the objective function are Linear equations. What makes these problems easy (both for humans and computers) is the fact that the optimal solution - be it for maximization or minimization always lies at a corner of the feasible region.

### Programming Language used
I will use `R` for solving these problems. Specifically I will use the package `lpSolve`

### Repository Structure
`.rmd` files are the RMarkdown notebooks with the code to do the optimisation problems. <br>
`.md` is the markdown with the final results.
