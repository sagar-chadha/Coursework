Use definitions to prove that

(*A*<sup> − 1</sup>)<sup>*T*</sup> = (*A*<sup>*T*</sup>)<sup> − 1</sup>

Problem 2

A bank makes four kinds of loans to its customers, and these loans yield
the following annual interest rates to the bank: . First mortgage 14% .
Second mortgage 20% . Home improvement 20% . Personal overdraft 10%

We are interested in the bank’s lending strategy. The information we
know is as following: 1. In total $250 million is lent out. <br> 2.
First mortgages are 55% of all mortgages (i.e., first and second
mortgage) issued. <br> 3. Second mortgages are 25% of all loans issued.
<br> 4. The average interest rate on all loans is 15%. <br>

Calculate the lending strategy using matrix inversion.

Problem 3
---------

A company manufactures four variants of the same product, and in the
final part of the manufacturing process, there are assembly, polishing
and packing operations. For each variant, the time required for these
operations is shown below (in minutes) as is the profit per unit sold.

|           | Assembly | Polish | Pack | Profit ($) |
|-----------|----------|--------|------|------------|
| Variant 1 | 2        | 3      | 2    | 1.50       |
| Variant 2 | 4        | 2      | 3    | 2.50       |
| Variant 3 | 3        | 3      | 2    | 3.00       |
| Variant 4 | 7        | 4      | 5    | 4.50       |

Given the current state of the labor force the company estimate that
they have 100000 minutes of assembly time, 50000 minutes of polishing
time and 60000 minutes of packing time available.

Add the non-negative constraints which ensure a positive number of units
manufactured for each type of variant. Formulate this as a Linear
Programming problem with appropriate decision variables, constraints,
and an objective. Do not solve the program.

Problem 4

### Part a

Use “for loop(s)” and “if statement” within the loop to generate a 20 by
20 Lehmer matrix A where

A<sub>i,j</sub> = i/j, j &gt;= i

and

A<sub>i,j</sub> = j/i, j &lt; i
