Problem 2
---------

A bank makes four kinds of loans to its customers, and these loans yield
the following annual interest rates to the bank: . First mortgage 14% .
Second mortgage 20% . Home improvement 20% . Personal overdraft 10%

We are interested in the bank’s lending strategy. The information we
know is as following: 1. In total $250 million is lent out. <br> 2.
First mortgages are 55% of all mortgages (i.e., first and second
mortgage) issued. <br> 3. Second mortgages are 25% of all loans issued.
<br> 4. The average interest rate on all loans is 15%. <br>

Calculate the lending strategy using matrix inversion.
