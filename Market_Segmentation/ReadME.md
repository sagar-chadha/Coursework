## Market Segmentation strategy for a consumer brand
![Segmentation](https://github.com/sagar-chadha/Coursework/blob/master/Repository_files/segmentation1.jpg) <br>

In this problem, I look at the tweets for followers of a large consumer brand called 'NutrientH2O' and provide insights to their marketing team about the people that follow them on Twitter. I look at the kind of topics that users are most talking about and use these topics to cluster users into logical segments that can then be targeted using focussed marketing strategies.

Concepts Used - <br>
* Correlation analysis to see which topics are correlated
* k-Means clustering to cluster users into segments.
