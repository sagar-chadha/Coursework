## Market Segmentation strategy for a consumer brand

## The task
![Segmentation](https://github.com/sagar-chadha/Coursework/blob/master/Repository_files/segmentation1.jpg) <br>

In this problem, I look at tweets data for the followers of a hypothetical consumer brand called 'NutrientH2O' over a 7 day period and try to provide insights to their marketing team about their Twitter following. My strategy for market segmentation is to cluster together followers by the kind of interest areas that they most tweet about. 

## Concepts Used - <br>
* **Correlation analysis** to see which topics are correlated.
* **k-Means clustering** to cluster users into 6 segments using the `withinss` (within cluster sum of squares) metric.

## Practical Application - 
A knowledge of these clusters can be used by 'NutrientH2O' to create Twitter content targeted towards specific consumer groups.

## Repository Structure
`Market_Segmentation.rmd` has the R notebook with the code I wrote for preparing the report. <br>
`Market_Segmentation.md` is the markdown report with my analysis.
