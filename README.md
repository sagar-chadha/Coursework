### Hey there! <br>

If you are reading this before May'19, then I am currently enrolled in the MS in Business Analytics program at UT Austin. This is an intensive and hands on 10-month program that aims to transform quant geeks like myself into quantitatively trained story tellers through lots of projects.

This repository has been created to showcase some of the work I have done as part of this program. If you care to go through this in its entirety you will see, as I have while making it, that I have come a long way in the last few months in terms of both my quality of programming as well as the approach I take to tackle some of these assignments.

My weapons of choice for machine learning are R and python, hence you will find R notebooks and markdown files, and Jupyter notebooks here. 

## Repository Structure
The work you will see here is done as part of some course that I undertook in the program. However, it doesnt make intuitive sense for me to club my work under folders named after those subjects. Therefore, I have tried to club my work either by the main concepts I used while doing the work or the analytical model employed. 

Each folder will have its own ReadME file that will tell you more about what I have done.
