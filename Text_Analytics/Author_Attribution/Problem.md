## Problem - Author Attribution.

In this problem, I look at articles from 50 different authors and use supervised and unsupervised techniques to learn idiosyncracies of each author. Then I try to reliably attribute test articles to each of those authors. Concepts used - 
* Document Term Matrices
* PCA for retrieving important terms <br> <br>

Modelling techniques employed - 
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Random Forests
* XGBoost
* Naive Bayes
