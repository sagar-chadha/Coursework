## Author Attribution using bag of words

![image](https://github.com/sagar-chadha/Coursework/blob/master/Repository_files/author_attribution.jpg)

### The Task
In this problem, I look at articles from 50 different authors and use supervised and unsupervised techniques to learn the idiosyncracies of each author - what words do they use, etc. Then I use the bag of words approach to reliably attribute previously unseen articles to each of those authors. 

### Concepts used - 
* Document Term Matrices (bag of words)
* Principal Components Analysis for isolating important terms <br> <br>

Modelling techniques employed - 
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Random Forests
* XGBoost
* Naive Bayes

### Repository Structure
[`Author_attribution.Rmd`](https://github.com/sagar-chadha/Coursework/blob/master/Text_Analytics/Author_Attribution/Author_Attribution.Rmd) is the R notebook with the code used to produce the final report. <br>
[`Author_attribution.md`](https://github.com/sagar-chadha/Coursework/blob/master/Text_Analytics/Author_Attribution/Author_Attribution.md) is the final markdown report with my analysis.
