## Problem 1 - Green Buildings. Worth the investment or not?
![GreenBuildings](https://github.com/sagar-chadha/Coursework/blob/master/Repository_files/green%20buildings.jpeg) <br>

In this problem, I look at data for 7,894 commercial rental properties from across the United States. Of these, 685 properties have been awarded either LEED or EnergyStar certification as a green building. As a data analyst for an Austin real-estate developer, **my task is to investigate the possible economic impact of "going green" in her latest project: a new 15-story mixed-use building on East Cesar Chavez and answer whether investing in a green building will be worth it, from an economic perspective?** Since my boss isn't that statistics savvy I need to prepare a visual report!
