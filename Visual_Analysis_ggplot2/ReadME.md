## Visual Analysis with ggplot2
In the problems that follow, I try to use various visualizations in an attempt to answer the questions being asked.


## Green Buildings. Is it worth the investment?

### The task
In this problem, I look at data for 7,894 commercial rental properties from across the United States. Of these, 685 properties have been awarded either LEED or EnergyStar certification as a green building. As a data analyst for an Austin real-estate developer, **my task is to investigate the possible economic impact of "going green" in her latest project: a new 15-story mixed-use building on East Cesar Chavez and answer whether investing in a green building will be worth it, from an economic perspective?** Since my boss isn't that statistics savvy I need to prepare a visual report!

## Austinâ€“Bergstrom International Airport flights analysis.

### The task
![Airport](https://github.com/sagar-chadha/Coursework/blob/master/Repository_files/airport.jpg)
In this problem, I look at all flights that take off or land in ABIA in the year 2008 and try to answer the following questions using some cool looking plots - 
* What are the most common destinations for flights from Austin?
* Are these specific months when more flights depart from Austin to these destinations?
* What proportion of flights were cancelled from Austin in 2008?
* How many flights were cancelled to Austin?
* What are the most common reasons for cancelled flights coming into Austin?
* What does the average delay from Austin look like?
* Is there a pattern for certain destinations being affected more by delays?
* What are the worst times to fly for each month from Austin?
* Do weekends and weekdays have different patterns of delays?

## Concepts Used -
Various visualization types and parameter tweaks as allowed by the R package `ggplot2` and a bit of statistics.

## Repository Structure
`Visual_Analysis_ggplot2.rmd` is the R notebook with the code I used to prepare the report. <br>
`Visual_Analysis_ggplot2.md` is the markdown report with my analysis.
